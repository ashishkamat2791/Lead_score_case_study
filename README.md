## Lead Score Case study

### Problem Statement: 
- X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor at around 30% 
- X Education wants to make lead conversion process more efficient by identifying the most potential 
leads, also known as Hot Leads 
- Their sales team want to know these potential set of leads, which they will be focusing more on 
communicating rather than making calls to everyone. 

### Objective of the Study: 
- To help X Education select the most promising leads, i.e., the leads that are most likely to convert into 
paying customers. 
- The company requires us to build a model wherein we need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with a higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers 
with a lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. 
- The CEO has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.
